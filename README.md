## T-Tests
T-tests are a family of statistical procedures used to compare the means of two groups. They are a fundamental tool in inferential statistics, allowing you to assess whether the observed difference between two groups is likely due to random chance or reflects a true underlying difference in the population.

There are different types of t-tests depending on the characteristics of your data and the research question:
1.	Independent Samples T-test: Used to compare the means of two independent groups.


2.	Paired Samples T-test: Used to compare the means of two groups where the same subjects are involved.


3.	One-Sample T-test: Used to compare the mean of a single sample to a hypothesized value.
