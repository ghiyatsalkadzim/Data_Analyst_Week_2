## T-Tests
T-tests are a family of statistical procedures used to compare the means of two groups. They are a fundamental tool in inferential statistics, allowing to assess whether the observed difference between two groups is likely due to random chance or reflects a true underlying difference in the population.

There are different types of t-tests depending on the characteristics of your data and the research question:
1.	Independent Samples T-test: Used to compare the means of two independent groups.


2.	Paired Samples T-test: Used to compare the means of two groups where the same subjects are involved.


3.	One-Sample T-test: Used to compare the mean of a single sample to a hypothesized value.

Example (Paired Sample T-Test) :

## Machine Learning Regression
Regression is a statistical method used to understand and model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. The main purpose of regression analysis is to understand the extent to which the independent variables contribute to the variation in the dependent variable, as well as to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
- There must be historical data
- The historical data must be patterned
- Complex algorithm

### Preprocessing Model
An important stage in the development of a good model. It involves a series of steps to clean, transform and prepare the data to make it suitable for use in regression models.

#### Splitting Training and Test Set
This allows us to evaluate the model's performance on never-before-seen data, which helps ensure that the model not only learns the patterns in the training data but is also able to generalize well to new data.

#### Filling Into Training
The process of filling in (imputing) missing values in the training dataset before training the regression model. This is important because most machine learning algorithms cannot handle missing values, so special handling of incomplete data is necessary.
